## About Me
Hi! I’m **Debajyoti Dasgupta**, a Software Engineer at **Uber Technologies** with a passion for building cutting-edge AI systems and innovative solutions. I graduated from **IIT Kharagpur** with a **Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech)** in **Computer Science and Engineering**, where I secured the 2nd position in my department. My expertise spans across **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **computer vision**, and **recommendation systems**, with a growing interest in **multi-modal generative AI** enhanced by reinforcement learning and human-in-the-loop systems.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **AI research** and real-world software engineering challenges, designing solutions that push the boundaries of what's possible. From building robust pipelines and scalable architectures at Uber to experimenting with novel AI methods, I’m always seeking opportunities to merge research and application.

## My Work and Research
In my current role at **Uber**, I’ve had the opportunity to work on high-impact projects like optimizing real-time event management systems with **Kafka** and designing **gRPC APIs** using **Golang**, leading to significant improvements in system efficiency and performance. My contributions have led to a **70% increase in data processing efficiency** and a **40% reduction in service downtime** during traffic surges.

Beyond industry work, I’ve been deeply involved in **AI research**. One of my most exciting research projects was developing a **deep reinforcement learning model** for **smart scheduling of household appliances**, which led to **significant energy savings**. I’ve also published work on **intent classification** using **contrastive learning** and **synthetic image generation** for rare species identification, both under review at top-tier conferences like **NeurIPS** and **CVPR**.

My research interests extend to exploring how **large language models (LLMs)** can autonomously generate novel research ideas and evaluating their potential as **autonomous researchers**. I am also involved in research related to models and methodologies that are proficient in problem solving especially the mathematical aspects. I enjoy pushing the limits of **generative AI** and **reinforcement learning** to solve complex, interdisciplinary problems.

## Background and Education
I graduated from **IIT Kharagpur** in 2023, where I was nominated for the **Best Bachelor Thesis Award** and achieved a **CGPA of 9.78/10**, securing the 2nd position in the entire institute. My academic journey laid a strong foundation in **machine learning**, **deep learning**, **NLP**, and **AI systems**, while hands-on projects allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios.

Before that, I topped my class at **Apeejay School, Nerul**, excelling in subjects like **Maths**, **Physics**, and **Computer Science**, which sparked my curiosity about technology and set the stage for my future in AI and software engineering.

## Intellectual Pursuits
I see myself as a **multidisciplinary learner**, blending the fields of **AI**, **software engineering**, and **research**. I draw from my background in **statistics**, **algorithms**, and **linear algebra** to tackle challenges in modern **AI systems** and develop solutions that scale both technically and practically.

As someone deeply engaged in both research and application, I love collaborating with teams across disciplines and experimenting with new methodologies. Whether it’s applying **deep learning** models to **satellite data** at Stanford University or building **recommendation systems** that improve user engagement, I’m passionate about harnessing the power of data and AI to solve meaningful problems.
